## Spawn Points

Of the twenty landing pads in Tungsten Moon Demo, five are **base** pads, which are spawn points that you can return to at any time. The respawn control panel is on the right-hand side of the Sky Dart cockpit. Base pads are numbered 0 through 4, like this: 

* 0:0
* 1:0
* 2:0
* 3:0
* 4:0

On the surface of each pad is the direction (compass heading) and distance to a "child" pad. The child will have directions to other children, and so on, up to a total of four pads (including the base). Each child pad has its own unique number, based on its base pad number, like this:

| Base Pad | First Child | Second Child | Third Child |
|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 0:0 | 0:1 | 0:2 | 0:3 |
| 1:0 | 1:1 | 1:2 | 1:3 |
| 2:0 | 2:1 | 2:2 | 2:3 |
| 3:0 | 3:1 | 3:2 | 3:3 |
| 4:0 | 4:1 | 4:2 | 4:3 |


## Spawn Control Panel

You can keep track of your progress and respawn at one of the base pads using the respawn control panel:

Respawning resets the day/time clock to the day and time when the game was last (automatically) saved. With each session playing the game, the clock will continue to advance from the last save. This means that you will see each spawn point go through the full day/night cycle over a period of ten hours of playing time. With multiple days, you will also see the phases of the planet in the sky change as the Tungsten Moon orbits around it. You could even witness an eclipse of the sun, though the event is rare.
