## Run Tungsten Moon Demo in Steam (Easy)

If you don't already have a Steam account, visit the [Steam website](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) and download their free app for Windows or Linux. It doesn't cost anything to create a Steam account and you can download and run all the free games or demos in the Steam store.

Using your Steam account, search for Tungsten Moon in the Steam store, or visit the [Tungsten Moon store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3104900/Tungsten_Moon/) in your browser. There you can install and download the free Tungsten Moon Demo game.

### Steam Deck

Tungsten Moon Demo may be installed on your Steam Deck (Valve's hand-held gaming platform). Although Valve has not formally given Tungsten Moon a compatibility rating with Steam Deck, we use it as part of our development and testing process. Although the desktop version of Tungsten Moon uses a keyboard and/or mouse for some functionality, you can use the D-Pad view controls and the touchscreen to activate any in-cockpit UI elements using the Steam Deck, just as you would if you were using a mouse on desktop, or your virtual finger in VR.

## Download Executables from Github (Almost Easy)

The Tungsten Moon Demo is always available from [Github](https://github.com/Eccentric-Anomalies/Tungsten-Moon-Demo-Releases/releases). Download the binary executable that matches your operating system and choice of VR vs. desktop:

|  | Windows | Linux |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **Desktop** | TungstenMoon.exe  | tungstenmoon.x86_64  |
| **VR/XR** |  TungstenMoonXR.exe  | tungstenmoonxr.x86_64 |

If you are using one of these binaries to play Tungsten Moon in VR, we recommend using Steam VR as the OpenXR runtime. This is what we use for testing.
