> Maximum landing specifications assume simultaneous touchdown of all landing feet, and zero rotational velocity.

## Overview

The Sky Dart is a physically accurate simulation of a *sensible* fictionalized spacecraft. Although it has a throttle control and a joystick, it does not handle like a helicopter, and it definitely does not handle like an airplane!

### Throttle

The throttle control operates the main engine, which is located at the bottom of the spacecraft and exhausts downward. The thrust from the engine is directed upwards. Some simple rules to remember are:
* When the thrust is equal to the weight of the ship, it will begin to hover. 
* If the thrust is greater than the weight, the ship will begin to accelerate upwards. 
* If the thrust is less than the weight and the ship is aloft, it will begin to accelerate downwards.

> As you operate the rocket engine, fuel is consumed and the weight of the ship decreases. Hovering under manual control requires constant vigilance.

## How to Get Started
* Run the program.
* Allow the spacecraft to settle onto the surface, or immediately press PG-UP to begin accelerating away from the surface.
* Once off the ground, press SHIFT (ALTERNATE control mode toggle), then hold left-arrow or right-arrow to start rotating your craft. This will enable you to view the planet and/or sun in the sky (if present).
* Press SHIFT (toggle back out of ALTERNATE control mode)l, then use the right stick (controller) or the arrow keys to pitch/roll into a sideways attitude so you can accelerate horizontally. If you can bring your horizontal speed up to 700 m/s you will enter orbit. Try to adjust A ALT. and P ALT. values to be between 3 and 10 km. Watch the moon roll by.. 
* Try lifting off, then landing softly back on the surface.
* Try lifting off, then moving horizontally a few hundred meters, then landing softly on the surface with has little horizontal motion as possible.
