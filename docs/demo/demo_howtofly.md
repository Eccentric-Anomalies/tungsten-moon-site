## How to Fly the Sky Dart
Tips for flying the spaceship.

## How to Get Started
* Run the program.
* Allow the spacecraft to settle onto the surface, or immediately press PG-UP to begin accelerating away from the surface.
* Once off the ground, press SHIFT (ALTERNATE control mode toggle), then hold left-arrow or right-arrow to start rotating your craft. This will enable you to view the planet and/or sun in the sky (if present).
* Press SHIFT (toggle back out of ALTERNATE control mode)l, then use the right stick (controller) or the arrow keys to pitch/roll into a sideways attitude so you can accelerate horizontally. If you can bring your horizontal speed up to 700 m/s you will enter orbit. Try to adjust A ALT. and P ALT. values to be between 3 and 10 km. Watch the moon roll by.. 
* Try lifting off, then landing softly back on the surface.
* Try lifting off, then moving horizontally a few hundred meters, then landing softly on the surface with has little horizontal motion as possible.
