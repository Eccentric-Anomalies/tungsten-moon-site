# TUNGSTEN MOON

Tungsten Moon is a "flight simulator" for spacecraft. The setting is a fictional 600 km diameter moon of solid tungsten metal, orbiting a planet that is orbiting an imaginary sun. The game has few objectives besides learning to control a spaceship, but eventually there will be more challenges, features, and even a story.

The spacecraft controls allow you to control the main rocket thrust, while providing pitch, roll, and yaw torques. The fuel is limited, but there is enough to put the spacecraft into orbit around the moon.

Tungsten Moon will run in VR mode if a VR headset is detected. You can use full keyboard or game controller inputs in either mode. VR hand controllers support grabbing handles and pushing buttons (Vive tested).

## Demo Version

There is a [demo version of Tungsten Moon](https://github.com/Eccentric-Anomalies/Tungsten-Moon-Demo/releases) that you can download and try in Windows or Linux.
